# dodge-the-falling-objects
 A simple game made with Godot.

### Game Overview:
- **Player Control**: The player controls a character at the bottom of the screen.
- **Objective**: Dodge falling objects (e.g., rocks, bombs, etc.) that drop from the top.
- **Scoring**: The player earns points for every second they survive without getting hit.
- **Difficulty**: Over time, the speed and number of falling objects increase, making it progressively harder.

### Features:
1. **Player Movement**: Use arrow keys or "A"/"D" to move the player left and right.
2. **Falling Objects**: Randomly spawn objects at the top of the screen, falling at different speeds.
3. **Collision Detection**: If the player is hit by a falling object, it's game over.
4. **Score System**: Display the score on the screen, and increase it over time.
5. **Menu**: A menu with "Play" and "Quit" is shown before the game starts

It's my first game made with Godot. Inspired by [Brackeys tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0).
